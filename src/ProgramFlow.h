     * 1 - expect to create communication with the drivers. receive their id and send them
     *     data about their vehicles.
     * 2 - insert a new ride: (id,x_start,y_start,x_end,y_end,num_passengers,tariff,time_of_start)

     * 3 - insert a vehicle: (id,taxi_typ e,manufacturer,color)
     *                  - (int,{1: NormalCab,2:LuxuryCab},char:{H,S,T,F},char:{R,B,G,P,W})
     * 4 - request for a driver location: (driver_id)
     * output: driver location in the format: '(x,y)'.
     * 7 - exit (cleaning up the program and exiting).
     * 9 - advance the time and do the required operations (assigning trips to the drivers
     *     when the starting time of these trips is arriving, advancing of the relevant drivers)
